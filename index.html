            <p>Aero Mosley is a rising sophomore majoring in computer science at Howard University who hails from Houston, Texas and is seeking experience in web development. In the classroom, they have become skilled in utilizing Python. Beyond of the classroom, they have delved into working with HTML and CSS to create captivating websites—like the one you’re on now! Mosley’s pursuits extend far beyond coding and into the creative sphere. They infuse their problem solving with innovative solutions and this passion for art has led to dabbling in social media management and entrepreneurial endeavors, most notably founding Clawed Muse, a nail business, in 2023. They are also considering pursuing a minor in electronic studio arts to further hone their skills in applying technology with visual communication. They are also dedicated to serving their community, exemplified by their involvement in Howard University’s Alternative Spring Break program, wherein they managed the database for the student led service-learning organization until its culminating trip of joining over 1,000 students to serve 20 communities around the nation over the spring break period. 
                While not working on new features for their personal website, Aero Mosley enjoys cozying up with a good book or watching the latest horror flick.
