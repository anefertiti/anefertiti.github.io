                <h3>Returning the Art History Degree to Howard University</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="essay">
                <p style="text-indent:15px;">In 2021, Howard University stopped offering their Bachelor of Arts degree in Art History, leaving the remaining students to complete their degree by 2025. I believe that his has been a serious disservice to students and for society as a whole. With my passion for art history and cognizance of the role of art within the history of the African Diaspora, my capacity for diversifying the art world through curating galleries is hindered. I love my school. I wouldn’t rather receive my education from any other institution. It’s extremely unfair that I must choose between a school with a culture that cannot be beat or a different college where I would receive an unequally holistic education. Moreover, an art history program with a curriculum discussing African art with such depth is unfortunately rare. In this essay I will advocate for the reinstatement of the art history degree by its impact, the necessity of Black art history, and the importance of continuing to offer the degree.</p>
                <p><b>Introduction to Howard University's Art History Degree</b></p>
                <p style="text-indent:15px;">The 2022-2023 undergraduate catalogue defines the art history B.A. as focusing on “African American art and the art of the African Diaspora” and rooted in the “original scholarship in African American and African Art History”. It’s unique in the way it required courses and provided many elective options that allow candidates to interact with more courses with ties to the African Diaspora. Even the more general art history courses such as “Topics in Art Criticism” have an “emphasis” on studying the African diaspora and the artistic production from these communities. These courses are unique because most required courses for achieving a B.A. in art history center around the European evolution of art, completely excluding the perspectives and contributions of artists from the African diaspora. It’s also highly unlikely that they will even explore the connections to this world, whereas Howard’s courses investigate the influences that Black art has had on other cultures, such as Latin American art, and the influences that they have had on Black art. The importance of these courses that bring to the forefront the hidden stories of the African-origin artists that have influenced our culture and explore the connections between them cannot be overstated.</p>
                <p style="text-indent:15px;">Howard University has always played an instrumental role in influencing and creating a diverse atmosphere for all sectors of society. Its art department specifically has created a meaningful progressive change in attitudes and appreciation of Black arts since its inception. An essay written by Rebecca VanDiver titled “Art Matters: Howard University’s Department of Art from 1921 to 1971” details the multiplicity of ways that Howard’s art department has evolved and made significant contributions to society throughout the years. It opens with stating that “Howard University has been an epicenter of Black intellectualism frequently hailed as the “capstone of Negro education.””. This solidifies Howard’s position within the context of Black society and how it has continuously cultivated and created conscious, influential thinkers. Within the first 10 years of its founding, John A Cole, in a report to the Board of Trustees, highlighted how critical “music drawing and other accomplishments should be within the reach of all”. The legacy of Howard’s art department as a center for advancing African American art history and shaping twentieth-century African art (VanDiver 1201) begins in the 1930s when it began consciously connecting Black artists from the past, present, and future with the incoming generation of Black students tasked with both creating and contextualizing art.  In the late 1960s, students began demanding a more “Afro-centric” curriculum. The students of the art department were not excluded from this desire, in fact, they were the most affected by the changes made in response to their grievances. They were informed by the then recent political events of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. which shows how interconnected the students, their perception of art’s place in society, and their understanding of the changing revolutionary political climate of the time were. They recognized that receiving an education pertinent to the societal issues that they faced uniquely as Black Americans was and still is central to being able to revolutionize culture and seek equality. Moreso, they were able to understand how key the arts are in doing this. The evolution of this department shows how it increasingly became more compatible with and suited for the desires of the students and for the good of the perseverance of African American department. Through the programs they provided, they were able to create an environment for art more capable of involving the Black community in Washington, DC. These events prove that Howard has had a longstanding relationship with valuing the artistic development of African American culture that has been repeatedly prioritized. </p>
                <p><b>Black (art) History</b></p>
                <p style="text-indent:15px;">In an essay for Journal of Art for Life titled “Understanding the Role of Art in Social Movements and Transformation”, Melody K. Milbrandt connected the creation of and interaction with art to the social movements around the time of its creation. Through this, she found that art was able to directly influence social perception of issues and people and was helpful in the communication of the ideals of movements and the people both within and outside of them. Art can function as a source of empowerment, a platform for critiques of activism and a propagator of social change which makes it an indispensable tool for understanding history. Art provides valuable insight into the functions of a community from many perspectives and these narratives are essential in the African Diaspora.</p>
                <p style="text-indent:15px;">The dehumanizing and isolating process that has created the African Diaspora has left members of the community to deal with discrimination and oppression in their new locations. Being barred from more direct methods of building political power and social status necessary to achieve the new dream of forming a confident self-identity, this pursuit had to be done through methods that engaged individuals more. A clear way of doing this was through art and the development of educational systems that centered the Black experience. The book Pan Africanism in the African Diaspora by Ronald W. Walters discusses this concept in its postscript where he states that “the substance of politics must be directed toward defending the culture elements—music, art, education, and the like”. (Walters 386) He specifically relates this development to the ideology of Pan Africanism, which is defined in the book as “the highest political expression of Black power” (Walters 68) This quote and the book as a whole demonstrate how critical the arts have historically been for the expression of Black thought. Through this, we can understand how important it is that we continue to use art as a tool for learning about Black history. Its function as a way of disseminating critical ideas to influence political thought and the activism that springs from it helps us in the present understand the struggles of the past. </p>
                <p style="text-indent:15px;">On episode 2 of the Pearl Lam Podcast, the host, Pearl Lam, invited Alamo Akinkugbe to have an important conversation on why Black art history matters. Akinkugbe is the owner of the influential Instagram page, @ablackhistoryofart, that regularly posts about the different art pieces that have connections to African culture through artist or subject as a method of educating people on Black history. This demonstrates the accessibility of art as a valuable method of understanding Black culture and the societal issues that members of the African Diaspora face. Akinkugbe discusses the motivation for the creation of her account. She credits it to the experience that she endured at Cambridge University where she realized that throughout the entirety of her first semester, she wasn’t introduced to even a single African or Black artist. This appalled her and indicated to her the necessity of her work and the inclusion of art that reflects the identity and history of African Diasporic culture. She further discusses how important it is for Black people to be historians of Black art. People who were not taught (either by experience or formal education) the intricacies of Black life are entirely capable of provide valuable information however it is incomparable to the analyses that can be made by people equipped with a fundamental understanding of the contexts of Black artistic production. She explains how detrimental leaving the task of defining what art history is to only those outside of the culture it examines is. It only further contributes to the persistence of the silencing of the Black narrative that Howard’s liberal arts department has fought against since its institution. </p>
                <p><b>Implications and Conclusion</b></p>
                <p style="text-indent:15px;">The implications of taking away such a key and uniquely diverse art history program are detrimental. The documentary Black Art: In the Absence of Light details the stories of key figures within the history of African American art and the importance of and context behind their work. The movie pays special attention to causes of the reactions that these artists received from the public and analyzes how effective their works were in projecting the vision the artist’s had to the audience. It discusses an exhibit titled “Harlem on my Mind” displayed in the MET exhibiting a portrayal of the lives of African Americans in Harlem. To the curators’ surprise, it was met with an outstanding amount of criticism by the Black community because there were no Black people involved in the curation of the exhibit. Due to this, the community of Harlem felt represented inaccurately and this issue lied with the simple fact that a curator cannot build an exhibit outside of the scope of their imagination and to the white curators of the time, Harlem was a completely foreign concept that they could not imagine how to publicize with justice. Black art historians like David Driskell were able to “bridge the gap” between what Black artists were communicating and what audiences looking into the culture were receiving.</p>
                <p style="text-indent:15px;">This documentary shows us how without Black art historians dedicating themselves to learning about art through a Black lens, there would be a devastating gap in the reception of Black art as well as a drop in society’s understanding of Black culture. Art is a wonderful educational method because its accessible and causes the viewer to truly think and consider what they see. Black people must be the voices contributing to framing the idea of what Black history and Black artistic production is because without them, the legacies of Black artists can become misconstrued and neglected. A statistic is shown that 85% of artists in American galleries are white and only 1% are Black. This overwhelming gap in representation will never be resolved unless there are Black people assuming fundamental positions within museums to change this, and Howard University could be aiding in providing a solution to this issue.</p>
                <p style="text-indent:15px;">My message to Howard is that the work is not, and will never be, done. There is a responsibility that Howard University has as a leading HBCU and a producer of thousands of great Black minds to hold firm in its mission of ensuring that Black history be uncovered and understood wholly within all of the contexts that created it. Furthermore, as a majority female university with a thriving queer community, they are squandering our power to serve as a site where a multiplicity of revolutionary perspectives could have a site to be analyzed and popularized truthfully to the intent of the artists that created it. I assert that the history of art within the Black community is a category that must be considered as essential to both the Black and American canon. There is abundant educational value in continuing the art history program because art is a key tool for authentically understanding historical contexts and events. The production of Black art historians can be undeniably beneficial to the art world and the global understanding of Black history and culture and there are simply no other institutions that provide the educational value of curriculum diversity. In conclusion, the reinstatement of the Bachelor of Arts in Art History degree should not be seen as optional but rather a necessary step for rectifying the global understanding of Black culture. Howard to fulfill its aim. Howard University must reclaim its status as an institution that creates scholars prepared to change the global issues impacting the African Diaspora by continuing to be a pivotal site for upholding the integrity of Black art and history for the following generations.</p>

                <h3>Black (art) History</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="essay">
                <p style="text-indent:15px;">To understand Black history, we must first consider the intricacies of Black art from the time periods we investigate. Art has long been used in the African American community as a form of resistance and expression, a cry to be heard and understood often fallen on deaf ears. Recognizing that Black history is fundamentally equivalent to Black art history is to appreciate the profound importance of artistic expression to the spirit of the Black community. Through exploring three pivotal eras of Black art—the Harlem Renaissance, the Black Arts Movement, and the Black Lives Matter movement—I hope to illustrate the connection between each movement, and the key figures within them, and the notable imprint each had on the sociopolitical atmosphere of their era through unrelenting creative expression. By examining these periods and artists closely within their context and the societal changes after it, it becomes evident that Black art is more than a byproduct or decorative element of African American culture, but an integral tool for creating the Black identity and a framework for their activism.</p>
                <p><b>The Harlem Renaissance</b></p>
                <p style="text-indent:15px;">The Harlem Renaissance was an intellectual resurgence of African American artistic expression that reached its height in the 1920s to 1930s was a crucial precursor to the African American movements that followed it. In the face of the pervasive racist narratives, like those prominent in films such as Birth of a Nation which portrayed Black life in America as dismal without slavery, the Renaissance instilled a sense of racial pride that beckoned to others to fight for their survival. At its core was the idea of a “New Negro”, separate from the limiting stereotypes of the Black experience perpetuated by white culture, marked by their refusal to remain complicit in the creation of their own narrative in American history. </p>
                <p style="text-indent:15px;">At the forefront of this movement stood W.E.B. Du Bois, an author and civil rights activist, who believed that the purpose of creating art should be for use as political propaganda to “gain the right of Black folk to love and enjoy”, a sentiment shared by many of his contemporaries. This motivated him to dedicate his literature to uncovering the truth of racial prejudice, a desire which birthed the NAACP’s flagship publication, The Crisis, in 1910. This paper gave him a platform to express his opinions on how the African Diaspora can become more united to an international audience, while amplifying the voices of other Black intellectuals and activist, solidifying the magazine in the heart of the Black community. This made it a vital channel for the growth and literary movement of the Harlem Renaissance and became a wellspring of thought from other rising writers of the era. In 1911, Du Bois extended his purview from academic literature to his ambitious stage play, “The Star of Ethiopia”. Crafted to be a large luxurious American historical pageant, Du Bois sought to fight the prejudiced belief that African Americans weren’t capable of deep intellectual and creative thought. Throughout its three productions, nearly 35,000 people attended to see the 1,010 actors present the harrowing history of how the African became African American. The play unfolded from the start of Black history, from the invention of the iron to Africa becoming an extravagant location for art and commerce. Du Bois then leads them through “The Valley of Humiliation” which portrayed the horrific experience of the slave trade and creation of a Diaspora fighting against oppression. He ends it with his vision of Black people rising from slavery and its consequences, now released from the constrictive role in society placed on them and able to now live with hope. </p>
                <p style="text-indent:15px;">Through these two creative endeavors, Du Bois was able to capture the mind of the African American community and encourage scholarship. The Crisis became a beacon for Black scholars and the community at large who desired to expand their view on Black politics by reaching those who were typically uninterested in engaging with the political sphere by speaking to them in a universal language: art. For this same reason, “The Star of Ethiopia”, although he had little experience as a playwright, touched the hearts of both Black and white audiences through the entertainment and educational value it held. Fueled by superiority complexes and the projection of inferiority onto the Black population, it was difficult to for African Americans to become respected academically in the eyes of the white scholars dictating the rules of society. Art in this time became a way not only for Black people to authentically express themselves and portray the intimate reality of their experience, but a method of transcending racial divides and communicating with the white population that oppressed them and convey their desire and right for equality. </p>
                <p><b>The Black Arts Movement</b></p>
                <p style="text-indent:15px;">The Black Arts Movement (BAM) was an African American-led arts movement from 1965 to 1975 that focused on creating art about the Black experience for the consumption of the Black audience. The foundation for this movement was an expansion from the groundwork laid by the Harlem Renaissance but rather than the central focus of forming the Black identity in spite of segregation and oppression, the Black Arts Movement was centered around expressing unapologetic Black pride. In this way, it was the “aesthetic and spiritual sister of the Black Power concept” according to Larry Neal, a prominent scholar in the movement. The BAM encouraged Black people to establish their own creative institutions, such as publishing houses and theatres, which built the foundation for implementing African American Studies programs in universities. </p>
                <p style="text-indent:15px;">Amiri Baraka, born LeRoi Jones, is a poet considered to be the father of the Black Arts Movement. His work focused on bringing the past of his collective ancestors to the forefront and intertwining it with modern Black life in America. Baraka’s strength was that he understood art intimately as a site for revolutionizing the Black masses. By ensuring his literature always remained closely connected to community organization and the issues of the people, he was able to create concrete change in his city. The 1967 Newark Rebellion, a response to the police beating of cab driver Frank Smith, highlighted the injustice of police brutality and incited a desire in the majority Black community of Newark for Black city leaders who could support their needs. Baraka used his poetry to speak directly to the locals and encourage them to participate in their local politics. When Gibson, a Black from, ran for mayor of Newark in 1970, Baraka campaigned endlessly to mobilize Black voters in favor of him. Despite the relentless efforts of the NPD to band together and vote for Gibson’s opponent, Addonizio, who would have continued mob relations within the police force and enabled them to perpetuate violence against the community, Gibson went on to become one of the first Black mayors elected in a major US city on account of the strength of Black voters. This success is an outward representation of the cultural change in attitude for the Black community marking when “Black power rhetoric [became] a reality”.</p>
                <p style="text-indent:15px;">Baraka mastered the art of using poetry to communicate directly with the locals which is tantamount to addressing the top of society, since the power of a society lies within its citizens. His work served as a mirror reflecting both the beautiful and ugly complexities of Black life, weaving the collective experiences of his ancestors and of his contemporaries, while also serving as a beacon for social and political change. His activism regarding the Newark Rebellions exemplifies how art can galvanize communities to actively participate in their own political empowerment, spark dialogue on how to pivot towards meaningful results, and bring philosophy into action for a tangible outcome. Particularly admirable was his personal investment in actively creating and fostering community, which he demonstrated by using his house as a center for teaching youth music and establishing it as a safe haven for Black children and scholars. Baraka’s accomplishments and sacrifices within the Black Arts Movement challenges provide valuable insight into the significance of Black art as a vehicle for challenging systemic injustice through utilizing the strength of an empowered community.</p>
                <p><b>Black Lives Matter</b></p>
                <p style="text-indent:15px;">Although its inception was in 2013 following the acquittal of George Zimmerman, a police officer that killed Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African American teen from Florida, the Black Lives Matter movement rose to its peak as a global movement in 2020 following the brutal murder of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black father, by police officer Derek Chauvin in Minneapolis. This tragedy sparked international unrest in the face of increasing police brutality and violation of the rights of Black people and other minorities. A unique aspect of this movement was its dedication to public art. I believe that the power of art demonstrated by the Black Lives Matter movement is characterized by the mass call to creation in a digital era. This movement exemplifies the power of a community working together and due to this, this section will be treated in the context of the aggregation of art created under the movement rather than limiting the exploration to a single artist.</p>
                <p style="text-indent:15px;">With this movement, public thought shifted from portraying Black culture and life towards highlighting and showcasing how we survive in the face of destruction. Many works, such as A Prayer to the Iyami by Patrisse Cullors, focused on using the body as a vessel for this indicates the understanding that this wave of violence was a direct target on the material and spiritual body of the African American collective being. This performance depicts Cullors’ attempt to reconcile the loss of her brother to the penal system when he was only 19 years of age, symbolized by the 20-pound wings fashioned from her brother’s clothing that she carries on her back. The 20 pounds represent the two decades that Cullors spent trying to free her brother from incarceration and brutal mistreatment due to his mental health issues. By using her body to portray this message rather than solely displaying the wings as a sculpture, the artist passionately asserts that she will not be ignored and defiantly commands the audience to truly regard her presence. Cullors utilized her art to compliment the work she was doing as the cofounder of the Black Lives Matter movement and her endeavors show how necessary art is to healing the self and community in dire times. Art of the Black Lives Matter movement focused on revering the many losses of the time and stood as a testament to a national grieving for the lives of mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, and loved community members. It is the epitome of healing through community as an act of resistance. Community murals were a prevalent method of portraying the shared feelings of loss and there was a strong rise in murals dedicated to the victims of police brutality. On June 5th, 2020, the mayor of DC commissioned 8 local artists to paint two blocks of the city with the words Black Lives Matter. This demonstration soon spread to many other cities and even nations globally, such as Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. These murals indicate a city that is unwilling to stay complicit to international mass violence against their minority communities. By creating public art, especially murals placed on the road, the community constantly reminds itself what they are working toward and raises awareness to everyone and makes the issue of systemic violence against Black people unavoidable.</p>
                <p style="text-indent:15px;">These pieces are a visual collective cry of resistance against injustice. Through these visceral portrayals of loss and resilience, Cullors pays homage to her family story, one fraught with unjustified police cruelty through her life, while also representing the countless Black individuals ensnared in the workings of vicious judicial system. This seamless combination of personal narrative and communal experience underscores the inherent power of Black art as a tool for understanding self in the context of society and calling out the incongruencies within our society. The proliferation of murals during this time, like the streets painted with Black Lives Matter around the globe and murals of victims that fueled the movement, exhibits the strength that can come from an entire community commemorating their losses and refusing to be silenced. Patrisse Cullors demonstrates a dedication to utilizing art as the backbone of her political movement as she integrates and uplifts the self-expression of Black people.</p>
                <p><b>The Importance of Studying Black Art</b></p>
                <p style="text-indent:15px;">As revolutionary poet and activist Langston Hughes once said, “African American culture could be defined through the arts”. To truly understand Black history is to embrace Black art as a necessary lens for analysis because it wholly embodies the authenticity of the spirit, struggles, and aspirations of a community striving for self-determination in a society that would rather see them fail. Through the Harlem Renaissance, we see art being used to solidify a Black identity in spite of white America’s ignorance. The forefather of the movement, W.E.B. Du Bois used his literature to uplift the Black community and spread understanding of the matters affecting Black lives in America. His work on the NAACP’s magazine, The Crisis, led to pivotal discussions on finding solutions to the problem of systemic racial prejudice. His other art forms, such as his plays, gathered public interest in Black history by portraying Black people with humanity and dignity rather than as a disgraced people. However, this movement had a tendency to center work for consumption of white audiences due to the desire to combat stereotypes at all costs in the era of Jim Crow segregation. Despite this and its decline after the Great Depression, the movement still left a profound influence on Black society, leaving the groundwork for the Black Arts Movement of the 60s and 70s. this movement saw a large literary revival and built an interest in studying African American history. Artists such as Amiri Baraka utilized this attention to written word to craft works dedicated to truthfully portraying the experience of Black Americans. He said that “art speaks to people. That’s why they use it against you” and his work clearly conveys his refusal to allow art to be used against him. Understanding the political power of art as a way to “unbrainwash an entire people” (Malcolm X), Baraka used his poetry and the status he gained from it to lead his activism in initiatives such as electing the first Black mayor of Newark. Most recently, the Black Lives Matter movement is cemented in the memory of most Americans, and many around the world. this movement showed a wide-scale increase of public creative expression as a form of resistance. Demonstrations such as “die-ins” and the creation of BLM murals in over half of the states in the US show a refusal to be forgotten in history or for the attitudes of a community to become misrepresented or warped by time. The co-founder of this movement, Patrisse Cullors, utilized her body as a canvas of remembrance and defiance and as a tool for healing in a time of increased violence. Throughout all three of these art movements spanning a century, the artist of the time used art to subvert prejudiced domineering narratives and express the authentic reality of the Black experience as a foundation for their political activism. Presently, the legacy of these movements remind us of the enduring power of art to provoke thought, inspire action, and shape the course of our future and the symbiotic relationship between art and activism. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="essay">
            <p style="text-indent:15px;">Overall, I really enjoy this class and the way that it helps us grow as a writer. The readings that we had over the semester really helped me see the different ways that people are able to craft a story. I was taught a lot about narrative through the articles such as What Bullets do to Bodies by Jason Fagone. The narration in the story showed me how I could be using the stories of other people in a way that becomes constructive to my main argument. It also enlightened me that maybe approaching writing from the perspective of an outsider reviewing the issue may not always be the best way that I could conduct my argument. now I see the value in speaking toothers and weaving their stories into mine. Another reading that opened my view on wiring was What We Hunger For by Roxane Gay. It can be difficult to speak about such a sensitive topic and I believe she did it wonderfully. This gave me new ideas on how I could write about real and harsh experiences that I’ve gone through and showed me that there are more connections in my life that I could be drawing to make a more interesting and unique story. </p>
            <p style="text-indent:15px;">This course has taught me how to consider and scrutinize myself as a writer. Through the process of choosing what to rewrite and how I could dramatically reimagine them, I noticed the habits that I fall into with writing. Although I considered myself a strong writer in more personal and less academic styles, I was able to notice that I felt less confident in presenting these pieces to others. As I searched for old personal writing to transform, I didn’t find any where I developed a coherent and interesting enough plotline to create a bigger work out of it. This brought to my attention that in my personal writing, I should be more open to writing with the larger message in sight and then developing a story from it, rather than only using my current approach of freewriting and searching for the meaning as I go. As I looked through my past works, I realized that I didn’t actually feel connected to many of them. I unearthed some that I wasn’t necessarily proud of, or pieces that I’d abandoned before bringing their message to fruition. For the ones I did feel connected to, I didn’t think that there was any avenue left to wander with them that was actually worthy of an entirely new essay; they all felt complete. However, when looking at my work from last semester, I found a piece that I thought about often and my ideas raced with how I could further this, both for my personal interest and to engage with the prompt.</p>
            <p style="text-indent:15px;">I was very excited to rework the essay I wrote last semester on why Howard University should reinstate the Bachelor of Art in art history degree program. The original essay had a strong focus on art history as a subject and Howard University’s legacy as the mecca of Black culture. I walked through the discontinued curriculum for the degree and explored its unique benefits compared to other art history programs. I also delved into the implications of not having such a degree at Howard University and the importance in fostering and producing Black art historians, and how irreplaceable of a necessity that is. Throughout the essay my main assertion was an exploration of the academic importance of Black art history and the value of giving the subject its due respect. While brainstorming for how to reimagine this essay, I dissected the aspects of it that could be expanded upon. I felt that the most useful and worthy essay to come from this would be to create a complimentary essay that not only worked on its own but gave context and weight to the core argument of its counterpart. I see of this second version as an attempt to show, rather than tell, the audience how integral art has been to the Black community and the necessity of understanding it to truly see Black history. For this reason, I gave it the title Black (art) History as a hand-me-down from the heading of the second section of the original essay. It’s an extension of this section where I elucidated the power that art has held in the African Diaspora, as told by modern art historians. I wanted to further this by looking into the specific art works that they mentioned and drawing my own conclusions on how they impacted society. To do this, I explored large artistic movements within a hundred-year span of African American history both in the context of their respective eras as well as how they were all informed by their preceding movements. By doing this, I hope to bring awareness to the beautiful tapestry that is Black history, one woven with authentic artistic expression in concordance with activism. This is the backbone and foundation of understanding African American history and I begin explaining this in the essay with the Harlem Renaissance. This movement began the creation of the African American cultural identity, with creating art at its core. This laid the foundation for the Black Arts Movement, a sister to the Black power concept, which supported and shed light on the activism during the Civil Rights Movement. I finally end the essay with the Black Lives Matter movement, in which we notice a shift from art supporting activism to art being activism. In this way the art is a majority of the resistance. This renders it as an ingrained part of Black history that must be studied to understand the culture of African Americans. </p>
            <p style="text-indent:15px;">At the end of writing, I was extremely pleased with the way that this essay turned out. I enjoyed the challenge of revising this without using the structure of the original essay or any of the sentences at all. I’m also glad to add this to a portfolio of work that actually speaks to me and what I care about and grateful for the chance to revisit a topic I care passionately about. Through rewriting my paper form last semester, I was able to challenge myself to think outside of the obvious method of directly telling the audience what I believe. My goal with this paper was to persuade the audience to learn more about Black art if they wanted to learn about Black history, which would also indicate to them why I assert that Howard University’s art history degree was necessary. </p>
            <p style="text-indent:15px;">For my second piece, I chose to write a professional biography for myself. As a first-year college student with no professional experience and few projects to show for my major, I felt that a biography was necessary to supplement my resume and showcase my personality and skills, but it felt very daunting for the same reasons I felt less confident in my resume. With little professional experience, I was forced to think about my personality and how to glean as much meaning as possible from the little experiences I did have. Before writing this, I had to do a deep exploration of myself to understand what the most relevant aspects of my personality to highlight in the biography were. I also had to consider my academic achievements, extracurriculars, interests, and the goals I have for the future. This journey of introspection helped me truly see my aspirations as well as where I could be growing. In writing the biography, I hoped to showcase a bit of my personality through my writing and include the projects that I was most proud of in a way that didn’t parrot my resume. I feel that this challenged me to figure out what the most authentic way to portray myself would be with the limitation of focusing only on what would be useful to an employer. </p>
            <p style="text-indent:15px;"> Finally, I enjoyed the website portion of the project because it was a valuable learning experience. As a computer science major hoping to go into web design, I have been in dire need of a website. It’s been hard to find internal motivation to sit down and code one from scratch, but this project gave me the push I needed. I originally struggled with balancing a professional look with trying to design it true to my interests but ultimately I ended up prioritizing showcasing more complex skills and proficiency in web programming languages over my personal design aesthetic, which I have decided to perfect on a separate website. At times I was slightly discouraged in how the website was coming along and tempted to concede and make a website with Wix or Google Sites, but I used this as a method of challenging myself and dedicating myself to creating and turning in a website that I would be proud of. The entirety of this project has been an incredible opportunity for self-improvement and has pushed me to embrace challenging myself by learning to see the value in the challenges. </p>
